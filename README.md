# Metro Systems Data Visualization

This project involves visualizing data related to metro systems from various countries and regions. The goal is to provide insights into the characteristics of metro systems, such as length, number of stations, annual ridership, and more. The visualizations are created using Python and libraries like Plotly and Matplotlib.

## Introduction

Metro systems are an essential part of urban transportation infrastructure. This project aims to visualize and analyze data related to metro systems to gain insights into various aspects of their operations and characteristics.

## Installation

To run the code and visualize the data, you'll need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/metro-systems-visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd metro-systems-visualization
   ```

3. Run the Python script to generate the visualizations:

   ```bash
   python visualize_metro_data.py
   ```

4. The generated visualizations will be displayed or saved (depending on the script settings) in the project directory.

## Data Sources

The data used for this project is sourced from the following CSV files:

- `metro_countries_total.csv`: Data related to metro systems at the country level.
- `metro_countries_cities.csv`: Data related to metro systems at the city level.
- `metro_countries_in_progress.csv`: Data about ongoing metro projects.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files:

- `visualize_metro_data.py`: The main Python script for generating data visualizations.
- `metro_countries_total.csv`: CSV file containing country-level metro data.
- `metro_countries_cities.csv`: CSV file containing city-level metro data.
- `metro_countries_in_progress.csv`: CSV file containing ongoing metro projects data.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Visualizations

The project generates various types of visualizations, including choropleth maps and bar plots. These visualizations provide insights into different aspects of metro systems data, such as system length, number of stations, annual ridership, ongoing projects, and more.
